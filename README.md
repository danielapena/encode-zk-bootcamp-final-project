# FinalProject - Anonymous Voting System using Aleo Protocol

## Introduction

Welcome to the Anonymous Voting System, a decentralized application built on the Aleo protocol. This system leverages the power of zero-knowledge proofs to ensure that votes are cast and counted in a secure, private, and verifiable manner. By using the Aleo protocol, we can provide a voting solution that maintains the confidentiality of each vote while ensuring the integrity and transparency of the overall election process.

This project is the final project of the ZK Bootcamp Q2 2024, showcasing the practical application of zero-knowledge proofs learned during the bootcamp.
